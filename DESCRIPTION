Description: The R datasets package provides a lot of interesting examples for
  use in workshops / tutorials. Very few of the datasets are in a tidy-data
  format and so need a bit of hacking before they can effectively be used with
  `ggplot2` and related parts of the `tidyverse`. This package provides some
  wrapper functions that hack these datasets into exemplar tidy-data format.
